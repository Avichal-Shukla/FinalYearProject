Park Smart (Smart Parking System)

INTRODUCTION

Problems related to parking the vehicles have always been an issue since the very first automobiles were invented. Parking is only part of the picture when it comes to street clogging. Large cities' traffic managers are always dealing with parking challenges brought on by deliveries and drop-offs. As we move towards future, parking planning will become an even more vital issue for urban people, adding to the mix of transport options such as self-driving cars, human drivers, cycle deliveries and more. With freestanding options opening up, previously empty parking lots could develop into crowded transit hubs.

This imbalance is partially due to ineffective use of land and miscalculations of space requirements during initial stages of planning. Shortage of parking space and traffic congestion due to visitors while searching for a parking spot are some examples of everyday parking problems. In major cities, as the development goes on, the parking generation rate increases rapidly which leads to major parking problem. Parking management is an effective tool for the local government to help them in reducing the single occupant vehicles and encouragement of the mass transportation facilities to influence the other aspects of parking supply and demand. For a greater supply of parking, we must develop the areas designated as legitimate parking zones, and we must also offer a means of parking for the areas designated as non-parking zones. The worst-affected cities are those in hill states, where parking spaces shamefully fall short of the current standards. Long traffic jams are common during peak times, and some of them can be blamed on careless parking of cars on the roads. Parking problems are a frequently disregarded part of urban planning and transportation, despite the fact that effective parking systems can also improve urban mobility and the environment while improving inhabitants' quality of life. When it comes to management, planning, and design, urban planners should look for more effective and creative parking options. The Smart Parking System intends to resolve these stated problems and provide an ease to mankind.   

Project Objective

1.	To develop an Android application where users will be able to find a parking space on their own in a quick way.

2.	Facility for the users to view various parking areas and select the space to view whether space is available or not just by scanning a QR code.

3.	Facility for the users to cancel their booked slots anytime.

4.	Reduce man power while searching for a parking space using automated system.

5.	Detection of wrongly parked vehicle using advanced machine learning algorithms.

6.	Verification of the car owner while exiting the parking lot. 

Applications

The system can be used in various shopping malls, apartments, hospitals, institutions or any other organization. The manual labour and costs are saved by the Smart Parking System. The online connectivity can also help the users to easily find a free parking space nearest to their location.

Advantages

•	It saves user’s time looking out for free parking places, roaming here and there on their vehicles unnecessarily for finding a parking space in hospitals, hotels,     supermarket and at many more places.
•	It saves manual labour as well as the cost of hiring.
•	The system provides verification at the exit to keep a check on fraudsters or cheaters.

Limitations

•	Internet connectivity is mandatory.
•	It can only be used for the parking lot of a specific area at a time.
•	Every time there is a change in the existing parking lot the application must be updated correspondingly.
